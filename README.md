# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using Kaggle dataset


Logistic Regression and Random Forest models have been used in this project. Although Logistic Regression has better recall rate, it lacks in precision, throwing many false fraud cases. This issue is alleviated using `Random Forest` at the slight expense of recall.
